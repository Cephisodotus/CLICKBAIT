# CLICKBAIT
### A Game by Marco Pagani, Hunter Nelson, and Rosa Cortez

What is a man without his clout? You are a disgraced influencer who is desperate to repair your tarnished reputation. Your last chance might just be Influcon, the one place where you can find the people who can help you crawl your way back to success. Talk to the hottest trendsetters across social media in a last ditch effort to save your cred. Move with WASD, press E to interact and use the mouse or spacebar to make choices.

This game was made for the Global Game Jam 2020, and is in ongoing development to further expand the prototype that was made then.
