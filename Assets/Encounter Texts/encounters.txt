Hey you've got some nice cheekbones! Want to collab on a tutorial? If you spot me for the supplies I'll give you first upload privileges!
Let's do it! Always wanted to find out what kind of foundation matched my complexion.

Awwww yeah buddy, you and I are going to do a video right now! My girlfriend is over there and I wanted to prank her. I’m going to pretend I’m going to break up with her! It’ll be gold. So here’s the plan...
You guys come up with a plan for a surprise reveal that Problem Boy is married to a catfish in India, and that he’s going to break up with her...not! It’s a joke!

You convince him to kiss you in front of her for the views.

You convince him to abandon this plan entirely, and propose to her for the views....but not before a flash mob sequence.

I’m not liking the quality of this palette I got from my sponsor. This is ridiculous! I need to do something...
Well, if you’re going to throw the palette away, you might as well give it to me right? (Despite the makeup’s counterfeit quality, it still has very nice shades)

Do a video where you paint yourself as a technicolor clown with the palette as a burn to the company
-2 -1 2 20
Ditch the metaphorical burn and actually physically burn the palette with a flamethrower.

Hmm. No one’s really been coming to my corner. Do you think I should unleash the Tarantula Scorpion Wasp? Kids are really into insects stinging other people. Pretty educational.

Omg...I’ve been involved in this drama with this so called Insta-baddie girl...she’s really annoying, and she stabbed me behind my back when I asked her if looked hot or not. I’ve been arguing with her the entire night.
I have RECEIPTS that YOU’RE the one harassing her. (you show her your 8 page Twitter thread recounting this)

Well, looks like your night is about to become a whole lot worse! (You take a hint from the Vloggers and throw a tarantula onto her. Time for views!)

I have to pose for this sponsor post. They sell water with a hint of mercury in it. I hear it’s a good cleanser. Any tips for the composition?
50/50 composition of the model and the product. Caption in something like “He wishes he still had me.”
5 2 4 20
Just the product is shown, but you put some weird colors in the water to make it look aesthetic.
-2 1 2 20
Just the model is shown, but the caption offhandedly mentions a link to the mercury water website. There’s also some heart emoticons and a prayer emoji.

There’s a race for the new release of PUREHEART - FIERCE FURY eyeshadow palette. I hear it’s sold out on the website already! Fortunately I have some spare ones. Would you like to collab with me on a video?
Sure! You could use some new style. 
2 -1 5 20
No thanks! You already know that the company is under fire for using chemicals in their makeup. Can you believe it? CHEMICALS?
0 4 -2 -20
No thanks. You already bought the PUREHEART palette and released a review before Tiana could! Staying ahead of the game (but your wallet does hurt now)
